Our application follows standard accessibility best practices learned in lectures. Below are the specific measures we have implemented to improve accessibility across the interface:

1. **Semantic HTML and Form Labels**

   - All form fields (login, registration, join page, create/edit modals) use Ant Design's `<Form.Item>` with `label` props, ensuring correct `<label for>` associations and screen-reader compatibility.
   - Buttons use `<Button>` elements with clear, descriptive text (e.g., "Log In", "Register", "Join Game", "Create Game"). Icon-only buttons include `aria-label` attributes to describe their action (e.g., `aria-label="Edit Game"`).

2. **Alt Text for Images**

   - All images include `alt` text. For example, the BigBrain logo uses `alt="BigBrain logo"`, and game cover thumbnails use `alt="Cover Image"`.
   - Decorative images (e.g., loading spinner in `MoleGame`) use `aria-hidden="true"` to be ignored by screen readers.

3. **Keyboard Navigation and Focus Management**

   - Interactive elements (buttons, links, form controls) are fully focusable via keyboard (Tab/Shift+Tab).
   - Modals (e.g., CreateGameModal, CreateSessionModal, EndSessionModal) trap focus while open and return focus to the triggering element upon close, leveraging Ant Design's built-in focus management.
   - Custom focus styles are retained (no outline removal) to ensure visible focus indicators.

4. **Color Contrast and Visual Clarity**

   - We chose high-contrast color combinations (e.g., `#1677ff` on `#ffffff`, dark text on light backgrounds) that meet WCAG AA standards.
   - Error messages and alerts (e.g., Ant Design `message.error`) use red on white with sufficient contrast.

5. **ARIA Roles and Alerts**

   - Success and error notifications use `role="alert"` implicitly via Ant Design's `message` API, announcing status changes to screen readers.
   - Modals include `role="dialog"` with `aria-modal="true"`, provided by Ant Design.

6. **Responsive Text and Layout**

   - All font sizes and container layouts adapt to varying screen widths (minimum 400px wide) without requiring horizontal scrolling.
   - Text elements wrap and truncate with tooltips (`ellipsis` + tooltip) for long content, ensuring readability.

7. **Accessible Charts and Data Tables**
   - In `OutcomeSession`, tabular data (leaderboard, detailed answers) is rendered using `<Table>` with header cells (`<th>`) and row headers for clarity.
   - Recharts graphs include `<title>` and `<desc>` elements for basic SVG accessibility.
